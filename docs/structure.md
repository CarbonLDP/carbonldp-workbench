# Workbench's Structure

The application follows a very standard Angular CLI application pattern.
You can read more about it in the [Angular CLI website](https://cli.angular.io/).

## Architecture

A folder called architecture is included in this documentation. The goal
of this folder is to document the whole architecture of the Workbench,
an overview on how the Angular application is structured in regards of 
its Modules,their contents (Components, Pipes, Directives, etc) and what's the
current state of the documented code.

### Tasks for generating the architecture's documentation

- `build:docs`<br>
    This command just generates the architecture folder based on the
    code and its comments.
