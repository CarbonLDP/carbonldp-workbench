				<p>
					While retrieving the application context <code>angular2-carbonldp</code> returned an <code>HTTP.Errors.UnknownError</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This usually means that the server response didn't include the necessary
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS">CORS</a> headers. 90% of the time, it's because
					the application you are trying to retrieve doesn't exist.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Double check that your application exists</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Other common reasons are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The configured Carbon platform host is wrong (right now it's set to <code>{{ carbon.getSetting( "domain" ) }}</code>)</li>
					<li *ngIf="carbon.getSetting( 'http.ssl' )">The platform server doesn't support https and you didn't turn it off (use <code>carbon.setSetting( 'http.ssl', false );</code>)</li>
					<li>The platform server is down or not accessible (open <code>{{carbon.resolve( "api/" )}}</code> in the browser to test it)</li>
